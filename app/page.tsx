          Values are the starting point of my job search. I built an app for
          cancer patients, supported sustainability at Amazon, helped elevate
          art in the blockchain space and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a technological optimist but believe that people have to
          intentionally build tools with deep vision, compassion and sincerity.
